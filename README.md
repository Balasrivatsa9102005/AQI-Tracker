Real-Time Pollution Tracker
Project Description:

The Real-Time Pollution Tracker is a simple and efficient web application that allows users to check the air quality of any city in real-time.
By entering a city name, the application fetches the latest Air Quality Index (AQI) and displays:

The AQI value.

A corresponding AQI level label (such as "Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy", etc.).

It uses a clean, user-friendly interface without any map visualization, focusing purely on providing clear and quick pollution data to the user.

Key Features:

Real-time AQI updates based on user input.

AQI level categorization for easier understanding.

Minimalist and responsive design.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

API: OpenWeatherMap API (or any other air quality API)

Future Scope:

Adding graphs to show AQI trends over time.

Health advice based on pollution levels.

Notifications for pollution alerts.
